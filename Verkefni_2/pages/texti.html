        <!-- Chapter 1 -->
        <h3>Chapter I — How many kinds of principalities there are, and by what means they are acquired</h3>
        <p>
            All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been and are either republics or principalities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long established; or they are new.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or they are, as it were, 
            members annexed to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them, 
            as was the kingdom of Naples to that of the King of Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince, or to live in freedom; 
            and are acquired either by the arms of the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.
        </p>
        <!-- Chapter 2 -->
        <h3>Chapter II — Concerning hereditary principalities</h3>
        <p>
            I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another place I have written of 
            them at length, and will address myself only to principalities. In doing so I will keep to the 
            order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
            I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states, and those long 
            accustomed to the family of their prince, than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to 
            transgress the customs of his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, 
            for a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he be deprived of it by 
            some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he should be so deprived of it, 
            whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have withstood the 
            attacks of the Venetians in '84, nor those of Pope Julius in '10, unless he had been long 
            established in his dominions. For the hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity 
            to offend; hence it happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause 
            him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well 
            disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the memories and motives 
            that make for change are lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.
